# Online Watch Store

Simple fullstack E-commerce website I built as a learning project. It still has a lot of features to add and improvements to be made.

# Missing features (Things I stopped caring about)
- Sorting and filtering products and orders
- Proper payment gateway integration
- Proper error handling everywhere
- Full test coverage (None for backend)
- Clean and refactored code

# Tools used
- Frontned: React, Tailwind CSS, Typescript
- Backend: Spring Boot (Java)
- Database: SQL database (I personally used MariaDB but any SQL database should work)

# Getting started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Potassiumxx/watch-store
cd watch-store
```
For frontned setup and details, see the [client README](./client/README.md).

For backend setup and details, see the [server README](./server/README.md).
